	// 				Bogeyman will think you are an elephant with wings\
	// 				Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman\
	// 				Tell him you've got soldiers in your bed\
	// 				For he will never guess that they are only made of lead\
	// 				Say Hush hush, he'll think that you're asleep\
	// 				If you make a lovely snore away he'll softly creep\
	// 				Sing this tune you children one and all\
	// 				Bogeyman will run away, he'll think it's Henry Hall!\
	// 				When the shadows of the evening creep across the sky\
	// 				And your Mummy comes upstairs to sing a lullaby\
	// 				Tell her that the bogeyman no longer frightens you\
	// 				Uncle Henry's very kindly told you what to do\
	// 				Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman\
	// 				Don't let him come too close to you, He'll catch you if he can.\
	// 				Just pretend your teddy bear's a dog\
	// 				Then shout out, 'Fetch him, Teddy!' and he'll hop off like a frog.\
	// 				Say Meoow, pretend that you're a cat\
	// 				He'll think you may scratch him that make him fall down flat\
	// 				Just pretend he isn't really there\
	// 				You will find that Bogey man will vanish in thin air\
	// 				Here's one way to catch him without fail\
	// 				Just keep a little salt with you\
	// 				and put it on his tail"
