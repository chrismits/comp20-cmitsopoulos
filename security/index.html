	<h1>Security and Privacy Assessment of Client-Side and Server-Side</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
		This is a security assessment document for both the client-side and server-side of a Historic Landmark
		web application. It will address, document and provide ideas for the resolution of these issues. The
		application under review is a webpage that retrieves the current location of the user, sends it to a
		database and then displays the locations of the people in the comp20 class along with all historic
		landmarks within a one-mile radius on a map.
		</p>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>
		In order to identify potential security issues in the program, I first observed client-side of the
		application, without knowing what the source code looks like. After this, I thoroughly inspected
		the source code for both the client-side and server-side. After observing the POST and GET requests
		to the server as well as their inputs, I fiddled with them using a series of request to the server
		using curl.
