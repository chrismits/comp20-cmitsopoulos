# Assignment 2: Historic Landmarks

## General Information
This project renders a map with your location on it as well as the location
of other users in Comp20 class as well as all historic landmarks within
a one mile radius.

* Your Location is marked by a human figure
* Location of other users is marked by the classic red marker
* Location of landmarks is marked by green markers

### Implementation
The project described correctly implements all of the features identified
in the specification sheet for this assignment. The only problem that was
present is that the location of the user is marked by a unique marker but
there is also a red marker on it that I can't figure out how to get rid of.
However, it is not that clear so there will probably be no misunderstandings.

### Collaboration/References
In this project, I did not collaborate with any fellow students. However,
images and some code ideas were taken from the internet. Here are the references:
