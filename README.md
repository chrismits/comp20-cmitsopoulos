# Learning Portfolio

## Purpose of this repository
This repository contains a portfolio of the Web Programming work I have done

### Favorite Lab/Assignment
My favorite assignment in this class is probably assignment #3 where we build a 
server for our landmarks project. I particularly enjoyed this one, because I 
got the most useful introduction/practice to serving web data that I think
will be something that will be extremely important for my future endeavors.
Learning mongo and express was something that I have wanted to do in the past
but never got around to do it until this assignment.

### Personal Growth in this course
Thinking about all the new technologies that I have tinkered with and used
in this class, this has been the most useful class I have taken so far.
Therefore, I am confident in saying that I have personally grown to a large
extent in this class.

### Key Takeaways of this course
- The importance of version control software such as git

Example: When working on assignment 3 (server side of landmarks), I was free to tinker
with anything I wanted (experiment on nodejs), because I had the insurance of a previous
version that worked fine and could go back to that version anytime. Without git, I would
have probably played it much safer and in the end would not have learned that much.

Example: 
I have started using git on all my classes (even for my essays), just because it is
so useful. This goes to show how important and helpful this information has actually
been to my work.

### What topic would I like to delve deeper
I really enjoyed the last couple lectures on web security. It is definitely something
I want to (and should) read more about, just because it is so useful and I think that
not enough emphasis is given on security in academics. Hopefully I will take security
before i graduate.
